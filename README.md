# Module 2 Challenge - Personal Porfolio WebPage 

## Project Purpose

    The purpose of the project is to create a Responsive Webpage Work Portfolio that I can use to show my deployed Web Applications for potential employers, with links to my deployed applications as well as information about myself and also information on how to contact me.

## HTML

    * Created main layout for the webpage and structure.

    * Utilized Div tags to create containers for the webpage to organize into sections. 

    * Nav tags at top of the webpage will link to correct section within the main body of the webpage.

    * Nav tags will also become bold when the user hovers their cursor over the text.

    * About Me sections contains image of me as well as short description about myself.

    * Images contained within the 'Work' section contain the following
            - Titled Images with link to the work, which are currently placeholder until applications are deployed
            - 'alt' descriptions in the 'img' tag for accessibility
            - When the user hovers their cursor over the image containing the link the image will change it's opacity and the text over the image will become bold. 

    * In the 'Contact' section the user will find links to contact me:
            - When the user clicks the 'Email' link the user will be directed to send an email to my email address.
            - The LinkedIn link is currently placeholder but once finished the user will be directed to my LinkedIn page.
            - When the user clicks on the 'GitHub' link they will be directed to my GitHub to view projects that are currently being worked on
            - When the user clicks on the 'Website' link they will be directed to my portfolio website to view my deployed projects. 
## CSS

The following has been done within the CSS file to offer a good user experience: 

    * All links and text will become bold when the user hovers of the text with their cursor

    * When the user hovers over the images in the Work section of the webpage the image will change opacity and a border will be added to help with user experience. 

    * Styling of the webpage has been done to direct the user to 'About Me' section first, then to view the 'Work' section and then 'Contact' at the bottom. 

    * Coding has been done within the CSS file to make it more responsive to different viewports

    * Media Queries, Flexbox and some CSS variables have been used to help with the design and responsiveness of the webpage.
